Lists and ArrayLists

- You can create lists in arrays (sequence of numbers)

- List = An ordered collection (aka sequence). 
The user of this interface has precise control over where in the list each element is inserted. 


----------ArrayList----------

- ArrayList = inherits from AbstractList, List interface

- Resizable-array implmenentation of the List interface. Implements all optional list operations, and permits all elements. 


- ArrayList can hold objects. It is different than defining an array (int[] myNumbers;).

- ArrayList is a class, so it can have its own constructor.
