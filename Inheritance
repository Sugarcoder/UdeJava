----------Inheritance ('extends')-----------

Inheritance = 'Is A' relationship 

Example: Dog IS A Animal


- Objects share common characteristics, but each one has their uniqueness as well. 

Example: Computers - Ipad, PC, Laptop


- Create classes that inherit from other classes


- Create a basic class like Animal, with all these common characteristic traits


- 'extends' keyword = will use from the other object (Dog extends Animal)


- 'super' keyword (inheriting from) = calls from the constructor of the Class that we are extending from



- Override = something that can be overriden (instead of using one method, you use another one because it is unique to that specific class, so you override the 'super' class)

Example: Instead of use eat() from Animal class (this is the 'super' class), use chew() for Dog class.
